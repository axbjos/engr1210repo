# Matrix Addition
#
# View the attached image for how matrix multiplication works

# first we need to represent a matrix in Python lists
# so...

matrix1 = [[1,2],[3,4]]     # so a matrix like this:    |  1  2  |
                            #                           |  3  4  |

matrix2 = [[5,6],[9,10]]    # so a matrix like this:    |  5  6  |
                            #                           |  9  10 |

matrix3 = [[],[]]           # need an empty to hold our values
   
# We want to add these two matrices together...

# Can you figure out how to do it?
